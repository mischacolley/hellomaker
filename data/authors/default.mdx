Hi üëãüèª I'm **Mischa Colley**. For more than 15 years I've been [casually exploring](https://opencampusproject.org) the evolving landscape of education, schooling and learning through an alternative lens. HelloMaker is one of the projects that has come out of that exploration.

In the context of HelloMaker I like to introduce myself by saying I'm first and foremost an unschool dad to two fantastic young people who are 7 and 10.

With this project I get an excuse to explore and tinker with tech in a playful way that I hope will keep my interest in it alive longer than my work as a [Creative Technologist](https://mischacolley.com.au/) otherwise might.
