Hi üëãüèª I'm **Mischa Colley**. For more than 15 years I've been [casually exploring](https://big-dust-9ee.notion.site/6af006f120644dfeb7c5be0f6dcf3252?v=92108802bade47e8984381ccec6e9290) the evolving landscape of education, schooling and learning through an alternative lens.

First as a recent Steiner high school graduate, then as a university student come university dropout and more recently as a parent of two children who are unschooled.

With this project I get to combine my expertise as a [Creative Technologist](https://mischacolley.com.au/), and passion for alternative learning, to work in and around the intersection of education and technology. I'm able to work on creating offerings to support people like me choosing alternative education pathways for their children.
