              As an unschooling parent Iâ€™m forever betting on the power of learning that takes place
              in the spaces in-between. With boredom. With interest. With opportunity. With asking
              questions? With motivation or lack there of. With{' '}

              My vision is to establish a mobile environment were young people can come together
              regularly to make, share, give, learn, play, participate, support and change.
            </p>

            <h3>Whats on offer</h3>

            <p>
              In a casual group setting young people will be supported to explore their interests
              around STEAM. This might be around art/craft, multimedia, visual design, robotics,
              coding, web development or a combination of related interests. They'll be encouraged
              to set a learning intention (so they can come back to it over a number of sessions)
              and pick a project to work on.
            </p>

            <p>
              My hope is that I'll work with a mix of young people who have participated in the{' '}
              <Link href="/program">Workshop Program</Link> and those who haven't.
            </p>

            <p>
              These sessions will require a fair amount of self autonomy and be guided by the
              following <Link href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</Link>.
            </p>

            <h3>Whats available</h3>

            <p>
              Some basic tools (like power and Internet access) will be provided to start and I'll
              have at least one laptop with me plus a few other bits and pieces. I'm working on
              creating a list of what I have / need. I plan to grow what's available overtime so a
              BYO DIY attitude will be a must in the early days.

            <h3>Where, When & How</h3>

            <p>
              Based on demand I'd like to begin offering popup sessions at different locations
              around the Byron Bay area in early 2025.

            <p>
              For the most part the makerspace will intentionally be delivered off-grid in an
              outdoor learning experience but I am activly scouting locations so please{' '}
