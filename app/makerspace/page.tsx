          <p>
            As an unschooling parent Iâ€™m forever betting on the power of learning that takes place
            in the spaces in-between. With boredom. With interest. With opportunity. With asking
            questions? With motivation or lack there of. With{' '}

            .
          </p>

          <p>
            It's hard to think of a better companion to this mindset than that of the{' '}

            . My intent is to establish an environment were young people can come together regularly
            to make, share, give, learn, play, participate, support and change.
          </p>

          <h3>Whats on offer</h3>
          <p>
            In a casual group setting young people<sup>6+</sup> will be supported to explore their
            interests around STEAM. This might be around art/craft, multimedia, visual design,
            robotics, coding, web development or a combination of related interests. They'll be
            encouraged to set a learning intention (so they can come back to it over a number of
            sessions) and pick a project to work on.
          </p>

          <p>
            My hope is that I'll work with a mix of young people who have participated in the{' '}
            <Link href="/projects/hellomaker">Workshop Program</Link> and those who haven't.
          </p>

          <p>
            These sessions will require a fair amount of self autonomy and be guided by the
            following <Link href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</Link>.
          </p>

          <h3>Whats available</h3>

          <p>
            Some basic tools (like power and Internet access) will be provided to start and I'll
            have at least one laptop with me plus a few other bits and pieces. I'm working on
            creating a list of what I have / need. I plan to grow what's available overtime so a BYO
            DIY attitude will be a must in the early days.
          </p>

          <h3>Location & Frequency</h3>
          <p>
            Delivered via popup sessions at different locations around the community (TBD based on
            interest) the space will be available for a couple of hours at a time. Likely
            fortnightly to start but I hope to increase the frequency.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the most part the makerspace will <Link href="/about#vision">intentionally</Link> be
            delivered off-grid in an outdoor learning experience.
          </p>

          <h3>Cost</h3>

          <p>
            I'll be starting with an introductory offer TBD and session will likely move to a tiered
            pricing model based on number of sessions attended and assistance / materials required.
          </p>
